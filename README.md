## Weather Forecast Website
Implementation of a weather search web application in order to obtain hands-on experience in the majority of web technologies such as HTTP, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, PHP, MySQL and JSON as well as in open APIs and third-party libraries such as Bootstrap and Open Layers (for displaying browsable, dynamic maps) to enhance the user experience.

More specifically,the implemented web application takes as input the user location (address, region, city) and unit preference (Celsius, Fahrenheit) via a search portal, and then obtains and displays current weather and weather forecast conditions in a visually appealing and responsive way. 

Currently the web application supports only locations in Cyprus but there are plans to expand the web application in order to support more locations. 

For this website to function smoothly (last 5 searches button only will not work), a database connection must be established. phpMyAdmin can be used for this purpose.
